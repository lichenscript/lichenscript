# LichenScript

A lightweight language compiled to JavaScript/C.
Easy to integrated with the Web Ecosystem.

## Why

LichenScript is designed to write untrustworthy plugins for an exist system.
For example, LichenScript can be used to write third-party plugins for your website/mobile app, which is isolated.
It has modern syntaxes such as pattern matching/discriminated union.
It's designed to be lightweight, easy to compile to target platform with very small overhead.

# Features

- Modern syntaxes, close to TypeScript/JavaScript
- Static typing
- Pattern matching

**Target C:**

- AOT compilation
- Fast cold start
- Lightweight runtime
- Portable(WebAssembly/Mobile)
- Reference counting
- Use the library of C/C++/Rust through C-ABI

**Target JavaScript(WIP):**

- Readable
- Small overhead
- Isolate environment

# Senerios

- Plugin system for a Website
- Game development
- Mini-program environment

# Get started

Follow the [documents](https://docs.lichenscript.com/get-started).

# Syntaxes

The documentation is still work in progress.

Check [Examples](./examples/).

# VSCode Extension

Install [lichenscript-vscode](https://github.com/vincentdchan/lichenscript-vscode) from the extension store.

# FAQ

## What's the different with Rust? Why not Rust?

LichenScript does NOT use lifetime.

LichenScript is a high level language.
I don't want the programmers to care about the detail
of the memory such as liftime/smart pointer.

LichenScript is designed to use the ecosystem of C++ in
Computer Graphic. So compiling to C is reasonable.

It can be easily integrated with Rust with C-ABI.

LichenScript supports inheritance.

## What's different from JavaScript/TypeScript?

- More lightweight to run, don't depends on a heavy runtime.
- The C runtime is very small, LichenScript's object uses reference counting to free memory.
- More static features.

### No exceptions and try/catch

Exception mechanism depends on a heavy runtime.
So it's exclude from the language.
